<br/>

<h3>Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.
To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games
must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.
